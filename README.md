## About
This repository is having information about how to publish a site, tools recommended and short description about me with styles added.

## Recommended Tools
It is very easy to publish a repository using GitHub Pages. To publish a website all we need is a browser, visual studio code to write our code and make changes easily, Git Bash and Tortoise git to push/pull our code from repository and local system. I personally recommend tortise git. It made me very easy to push/pull code from repository/local system without using and commands.
